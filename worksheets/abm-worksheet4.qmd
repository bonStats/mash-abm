## Data: `kidneycancerclean.csv`

Kidney cancer death rates[^1] by county in periods 1980--84 and 1985--89. We are interested in the columns `dc` and `dc.2`, which give the number of deaths from kidney cancer in each county, respectively in the years 1980--84 and 1985--89. The columns `pop` and `pop.2` are some measure of the population in the counties. We shall ignore the other columns.

`r download_data_buttom("kidneycancerclean.csv","kidneycancerclean")`

1. `state`
2. `Location`
3. `fips`
4. `dc`: Deaths from kidney cancer 1980--84

7. `popV`
8. `aadc`
9. `aadcV`
10. `dcC`
11. `dcCV`
12. `good`
13. `dc.2`: Deaths from kidney cancer 1985--89
14. `dcV.2`
15. `pop.2`: County population 1985--89
16. `popV.2`
17. `aadc.2`
18. `aadcV.2`
19. `dcC.2`
20. `dcCV.2`
21. `good.2`

## Activity 1: Getting started

Download and import the kidney cancer data into `R`. 

Think about these data: which aspects are striking and will need to be particularly kept in mind when checking the model fit?

```{r data}
#| code-summary: "Starting code"
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false

library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

kidney <- read_csv("/path/to/kidneycancerclean.csv", skip = 4, col_types = cols(col_skip(), col_guess()))
  # Discards the first 4 rows and first column.

```


## Activity 2: IID model

Suppose all observations are identically distributed. 

1. Is this model reasonable?
2. Propose a Frequentist estimate
3. Code the IID model in `Stan` and use the `rstan` package for inference
4. Check convergence and sample size
5. Compare the Frequentist and Bayesian estimates

## Activity 3: Independence model

Suppose all observations are independent.

1. Is this model reasonable?
2. Propose a Frequentist estimate and visualize it.
3. Code the independence model in `Stan` and use the `rstan` package for inference
4. Check convergence and sample size
5. Compare the Frequentist and Bayesian estimates

## Activity 4: Hierarchical model

1. Implement a Bayesian hierarchical model in `Stan` and use the `rstan` package for inference.
2. Follow a Bayesian workflow (iterating as need):
    - Build Bayesian model
    - Compute posterior
    - Evaluate posterior

3. Simulate synthetic data and perform the relevant posterior predictive checks.
4. Compare uncertainty of estimates to independence model
